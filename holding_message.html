        <p style="color: black; font-size: 14px;"> Based on the assignment specification this page would not exsist but alernatly an XML response would be		placed on the previous page, this XML response would be made using AJAX which would allow it to be displayed on the last page.<p>
		<p style="color: black; font-size: 36px;">PUT<p>
		<P style="color: black; font-size: 14px;"> If PUT is selected then a request should get the currency rate and value and insert a new record (or overwrite a existing record) in your data store.<p>
		<p style="color: black; font-size: 36px;"> POST<p>
		<p style="color: black; font-size: 14px;">If POST is selected then a request should generate a call to an external rates service and update the rate value (for this currency) in your data store (xml file).<p>
		<p style="color: black; font-size: 36px;"> DELETE<p>
		<p style="color: black; font-size: 14px;"> If DELETE is selected then the request will make a currency unavaialble to the service - 1200 error. However this isnt the case if the user tries to DELETE GBP as it is the default / conversion currency<p>
